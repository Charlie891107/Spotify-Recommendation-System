# 🎵 Taylor Swift Recommendation System

This project builds a content-based recommendation system to suggest Taylor Swift albums to users based on their musical preferences. We compared two different methods: **cosine similarity** and **K-means clustering**.

## 📚 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Kaggle dataset containing Taylor Swift songs and their audio features.
- **Goal**: Recommend Taylor Swift albums that align with a user's top 5 favorite songs.
- **Methods**:
  - **Cosine Similarity**: Match user profiles with albums based on average song attributes.
  - **K-Means Clustering**: Group songs into clusters and match users to clusters.
